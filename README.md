# 🌍 WorkScape: Connecting You with Opportunities

WorkScape is a modern **job-searching mobile application** built using **React Native**, **Expo**, **Firebase**, and the **JSearch API (RapidAPI)**.  
It's designed to simplify the job-hunting process by aggregating listings from multiple sources into a single, user-friendly app experience.

- A unified dashboard of verified job listings  
- Easy-to-use filters and keyword-based search  
- Personalized job saving and tracking features  
- Real-time data updates from trusted sources
